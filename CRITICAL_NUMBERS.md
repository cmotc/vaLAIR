Critical Numbers for tracking down memory errors:
=================================================

Parts of the system are pretty complicated in how they pass data back and forth
between objects and scripts, this document will help catalog critical numbers
that will help when reasoning about the nature of errors. For instance, errors
that happen exactly once per room will always be perfect squares.

        25 errors from 4 contexts (suppressed: 0 from 0)
        ^5x5           ^2x2
