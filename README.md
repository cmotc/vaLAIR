LAIR!
=====

LAIR! is a rogue-like dungeon crawling game that draws it's influences primarily
from Teleglitch: Die More Edition(Aesthetically), Borderlands(Mechanically),
and MMORPG's. It's been something I've been developing for a long time, and I'll
probably never consider it truly done, but it's abou time I start documenting
how to actually play it now that I'm going to have a version in a week or two.
Alot faster if I weren't so damn tired.
