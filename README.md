LAIR!
=====

LAIR! is a rogue-like dungeon crawling game that draws it's influences primarily
from Teleglitch: Die More Edition(Aesthetically), Borderlands(Mechanically),
and MMORPG's. It's been something I've been developing for a long time, and I'll
probably never consider it truly done, but it's abou time I start documenting
how to actually play it now that I'm going to have a version in a week or two.


History(Feels a little self-aggrandizing)
-----------------------------------------

It seems like there's a certain percentage of people who play video games in
their youth that, while they enjoy experiencing the medium, are doomed to
dissatisfaction as the video game that they truly want to play does not exist,
and is not likely to. The idea that is in the process of becoming LAIR! began
as that feeling for me, and like many people, this inspired me to learn how to
program computers. When I started the first version of LAIR it was doomed, I was
writing it in Visual Basic .NET while I took a VB6 class that used a VB4 book
from a teacher who had never successfully compiled a program. That version
didn't get much further than a character generator and a turn-based rules
executive that matched players and enemies and determined a winner based
entirely on stats and random rolls. It didn't even have a graphical
representation of the player.
